This is the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning agent I developed that learns how to play reversi. The algorithm it uses is called UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees) which is a variation from traditional Monte Carlo Tree Search, taking advantage of the UCB algorithm for solving the K-armed bandit problem.
